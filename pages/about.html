    <p id="artiststatement">In my creative practice I take a lot of inspiration from the ethos 
        of avant-garde cinema. I am particularly
         interested in exploring the space between photography and film,
          outlets such as durational film, long exposure photography,
           and early animation. In my practice I often mix analog methods
            with digital tools and I view my process as collaborative 
            one with technology. I welcome technological hurdles and 
            disruptions in my work. I have an inherent need to creatively 
            solve problems which often leads me down daring paths. I feel 
            a lot of pleasure in visual chaos and I want to match, smash, 
            and stack these fleeting sensations. Not with the goal of 
            deconstructing it but rather to make it all sing louder.
