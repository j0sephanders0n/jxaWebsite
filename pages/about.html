    <p id="artiststatement">In my creative practice I take inspiration from the ethos of avant-garde cinema. I am particularly interested in exploring the space between photography and film–the “grey space” where fleeting images come to life. I view my process as a collaboration with technology. I often mix analog methods with digital tools–from cyanotypes to risographs, from camera obscuras to virtual environments. I welcome technological hurdles and disruptions in my work. I have an inherent need to creatively solve problems which often leads me down daring paths. [Images capture visual pleasure / WHen You take a picture you own a part of it. My main goal is visual pleasure.] I find rhythm in visual chaos, and I have a visceral urge to match, smash, and stack these fleeting sensations. Not with the goal of deconstructing this chaos but rather to make it all sing louder.
